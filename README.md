### Interval Calculator mode
This is a test feature I've added so you can calculate the Interval time (time in seconds between photos) by spinning the Shooting wheel. You'll notice that as you spin the wheel, the calculator automatically adjusts it to the closest shooting time available. This is because you can't select part seconds for the interval.
If you notice any strange things, or have any suggestions for improvements, please email me <sighmon(at)sighmon.com>

## Description
The Timelapse Helper iPhone app is a companion for anyone interested in timelapse photography.

It's a simple app to help you calculate the shooting time needed to create timelapse footage of a desired playback duration.

Set the interval time (in seconds) between photos, the frames per second that you'd like in the finished video and the app does the math for you.

There's even a little email button to send your calculations to your friends or camera crew.
